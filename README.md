# So, What is This?
- This is a vector-matrix calculator specifically designed for the **University of Waterloo**'s **MATH 115**, Linear Algebra for Engineers. However, I think it works for all Linear Algebra courses
- It basically covers everything till the mid-term. For example:
  - Vector Addition/Subtraction
  - Vector Scalar Multiples
  - Cross and Dot Products
  - Matrix Addition/Subtraction
  - Matrix-Vector Product
  - Matrix Multiplications
  - Matrix Inversion and Transposition
  - Function Solving (in other words, RREF)
 - The following functions are after midterm in **University of Waterloo**'s **MATH 115**, and will be implemented during reading week
   - Pure RREF Function
   - Kernel & Range
   - Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
   - Determinants
# About the Author and This App
- I, OFTS_CQM, am currently studying at the University of Waterloo's Honours Software Engineering (SE30).
- I know that doing these repetitive computations is incredibly boring. Therefore, I developed this app. It's intended to help students save their time, so they can spend more time on more interesting things, like playing Minecraft
- Please do not use this app during Tutorials, Quizzes, Midterms, and Finals. The author is not responsible for any penalties received due to violation of academic integrity.

# For My Fellow Programmers:
- If you want to fork this repository and make some tweaks, just remember to enable assersion (add the following to VM Options: -ea:net.ofts.vecCalc...)
