# So, What is This?
- This is a vector-matrix calculator specifically designed for the **University of Waterloo**'s **MATH 115**, Linear Algebra for Engineers. However, I think it works for all Linear Algebra courses
- It basically covers everything till the mid-term. For example:
  - Vector Addition/Subtraction
  - Vector Scalar Multiples
  - Cross and Dot Products
  - Matrix Addition/Subtraction
  - Matrix-Vector Product
  - Matrix Multiplications
  - Matrix Inversion and Transposition
  - Matrix RREF
  - Matrix Rank
  - Function Solving
  - Finding Base for span
  - Determine if a vec is in a span
  - NullSpace(Kernal) & ColumnSpace(Range)
 - The following functions are after midterm in **University of Waterloo**'s **MATH 115**, and will be implemented during reading week
   - Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
   - Determinants
 - **Note: Some features are still experimental and thus are not included in the released version. To use these feature, please compile by yourself.**
# About the Author and This App
- I, OFTS_CQM, am currently studying at the University of Waterloo's Honours Software Engineering (SE30).
- I know that doing these repetitive computations is incredibly boring. Therefore, I developed this app. It's intended to help students save their time, so they can spend more time on more interesting things, like playing Minecraft
- Please do not use this app during Tutorials, Quizzes, Midterms, and Finals. The author is not responsible for any penalties received due to violation of academic integrity.

# Warning:
- This app is initially designed for personal use. Therefore, I used Java's default "double" to store all data. So, the thing is, double is not designed to store high-precision numbers. Therefore, it's common that the number you get from this app slightly differs from the standard answers, due to float point rounding error. Please do not use this when you need high precision. 

# For My Fellow Programmers:
- If you want to fork this repository and make some tweaks, just remember to enable assersion (add the following to VM Options: -ea:net.ofts.vecCalc...)
